# Getting Started
Project started on Node.js v21.1.0

## Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
cd ios && pod install
```
## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

or run from Android Studio

- open android folder from Android Studio
- press run app button (Shift + F10)

### For IOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

or run from Xcode


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
